operating system

This is a small kernel project that I decided to do to learn the basics of how a computer works  
So far it has:
- pmm
- vmm
- vfs & ramfs
- interrupts
- scheduler
- exec()

It is not finished yet, I had to put it on hold because of other programming projects

It is called **Franklin** because when I started it, I was reading the biography of Benjamin Franklin lol
